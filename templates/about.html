    <p>
        KTM AG (formerly KTM Sportmotorcycle AG) is an Austrian motorcycle and sports car manufacturer owned by Pierer
        Mobility AG and Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto. It was formed in 1992 but traces its foundation to as early as 1934.
        Today, KTM AG is the parent company of the KTM Group, consisting of a number of motorcycle brands.
    
        KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s, it has expanded
        into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars â€“ namely the X-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many
        street as off-road bikes.
    
        Since 2012, KTM has been the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe for four consecutive years. Globally,
        the company is among the leading off-road motorcycle manufacturers. In 2016, KTM sold 203,423 motor vehicles
        worldwide.
